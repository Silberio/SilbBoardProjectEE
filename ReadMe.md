## Message Board EE Project

### Getting Started

The runnable jar file SpringApp.jar can be found in the /target folder and is really the only required file in order to run the program *as-is*. This is built using maven and tomcat, creating a fully executable, stand-alone application.

To run the application, download SpringAp.jar to a custom location, navigate to it with command prompt and run **java -jar SpringApp.jar**
The application can be accessed by opening any browser at the url *localhost:8080/home*
